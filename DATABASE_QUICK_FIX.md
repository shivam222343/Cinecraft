# Quick Database Fix for CineCraft Media

## Fix the Database Permissions Error

The error you're seeing is related to PostgreSQL sequence permissions. Here's the quickest way to fix it:

### Option 1: Reset Database (Recommended for Development)

1. **Open PostgreSQL command line (psql)**:
   ```bash
   psql -U cineuser -d postgres
   ```

2. **Drop and recreate the database**:
   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS cinecraft;
   CREATE DATABASE cinecraft;
   \q
   ```

3. **Run the setup script**:
   ```bash
   psql -U cineuser -d cinecraft -f backend/setup-database.sql
   ```

### Option 2: Fix Permissions Only

If you want to keep existing data:

1. **Connect to your database**:
   ```bash
   psql -U cineuser -d cinecraft
   ```

2. **Grant permissions**:
   ```sql
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO cineuser;
   GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO cineuser;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO cineuser;
   \q
   ```

### Option 3: Use the Fix Script

Run the fix script I created:
```bash
psql -U cineuser -d cinecraft -f backend/fix-permissions.sql
```

## After Fixing the Database

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm run dev
   ```
